at the destination place.\nA crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.\nOnce a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.\nA crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.\nOnce a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at

These satellites are equipped with various instruments that can be used to take images of different directions in space using specific modes. The satellites can be turned, their instruments can be switched on and off, calibrated, and used to take images.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\nTurn a satellite to a direction.\nSwitch on an instrument on a satellite.\nSwitch off an instrument on a satellite.\nCalibrate an instrument on a satellite by pointing it to a calibration target.\nTake an image of a direction using an instrument with a specific mode.\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA satellite can be turned from a previous direction to a new direction only if the satellite is currently pointing to the previous direction.\nOnce the satellite is turned to a new direction, the satellite is no longer pointing to the previous direction but is pointing to the new direction.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is power-on.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is no longer power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument becomes not calibrated.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nOnce the instrument is switched off on a satellite, the instrument is power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched off on a satellite, the instrument is no longer power-on.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is pointing to the calibration target.\nOnce the instrument is calibrated on a satellite, the instrument is calibrated.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is calibrated.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the satellite is pointing to the direction.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument supports the mode.\nOnce an image of a direction with a specific mode is taken using an instrument on a satellite, we will have the image.As initial conditions I have that, instrument_25 supports spectrograph_mode_1, instrument_20 supports spectrograph_mode_1, instrument_34 supports thermograph_mode_0,

These satellites are equipped with various instruments that can be used to take images of different directions in space using specific modes. The satellites can be turned, their instruments can be switched on and off, calibrated, and used to take images.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\nTurn a satellite to a direction.\nSwitch on an instrument on a satellite.\nSwitch off an instrument on a satellite.\nCalibrate an instrument on a satellite by pointing it to a calibration target.\nTake an image of a direction using an instrument with a specific mode.\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA satellite can be turned from a previous direction to a new direction only if the satellite is currently pointing to the previous direction.\nOnce the satellite is turned to a new direction, the satellite is no longer pointing to the previous direction but is pointing to the new direction.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is power-on.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is no longer power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument becomes not calibrated.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite

space. These satellites are equipped with various instruments that can be used to take images of different directions in space using specific modes. The satellites can be turned, their instruments can be switched on and off, calibrated, and used to take images.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\nTurn a satellite to a direction.\nSwitch on an instrument on a satellite.\nSwitch off an instrument on a satellite.\nCalibrate an instrument on a satellite by pointing it to a calibration target.\nTake an image of a direction using an instrument with a specific mode.\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA satellite can be turned from a previous direction to a new direction only if the satellite is currently pointing to the previous direction.\nOnce the satellite is turned to a new direction, the satellite is no longer pointing to the previous direction but is pointing to the new direction.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched on on a satellite only if the instrument is power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is power-on.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument is no longer power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched on on a satellite, the instrument becomes not calibrated.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be switched off on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nOnce the instrument is switched off on a satellite, the instrument is power-available.\nOnce the instrument is switched off on a satellite, the instrument is no longer power-on.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nAn instrument can be calibrated on a satellite only if the instrument is pointing to the calibration target.\nOnce the instrument is calibrated on a satellite, the instrument is calibrated.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is on board the satellite.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is power-on.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument is calibrated.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the satellite is pointing to the direction.\nAn image of a direction with a specific mode can be taken using an instrument on a satellite only if the instrument supports the mode.\nOnce an image of a direction with a specific mode is taken using an instrument on a satellite, we will have the image.As initial conditions I have that, instrument_11 is on board satellite_3, the calibration target of instrument_10 is ground_station_1, satellite_2 is pointing to
