  I have to plan how to make and serve sandwiches for a group of children, taking into account that some of them are allergic to gluten. There are two types of sandwiches: regular and gluten-free.

  Here are the actions that can be performed:

  Make a gluten-free sandwich.
  Make a regular sandwich.
  Put a sandwich on a tray.
  Serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child.
  Serve a regular sandwich to a child.
  Move a tray between kitchen and tables.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:
  We can make a gluten-free sandwich only if there is a bread at kitchen and the bread is gluten-free.
  We can make a gluten-free sandwich only if there is a content at kitchen and the content is gluten-free.
  Once we make a gluten-free sandwich, the bread and content are no longer at kitchen.
  Once we make a gluten-free sandwich, the sandwich is at kitchen and is gluten-free.
  We can make a regular sandwich only if there is a bread at kitchen.
  We can make a regular sandwich only if there is a content at kitchen.
  Once we make a regular sandwich, the bread and content are no longer at kitchen.
  Once we make a regular sandwich, the sandwich is at kitchen.
  We can put a sandwich on a tray only if the sandwich is at kitchen.
  We can put a sandwich on a tray only if the tray is also at kitchen.
  Once we put a sandwich on a tray, the sandwich is no longer at kitchen but is on the tray.
  We can serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child only if the child is allergic to gluten.
  We can serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child only if the sandwich is on a tray and the sandwich is gluten-free.
  We can serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child only if the child is waiting for the sandwich at the table.
  We can serve a regular sandwich to a child only if the tray is at the table where the child is waiting.
  Once we serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child, the sandwich is no longer on the tray.
  Once we serve a gluten-free sandwich to an allergic child, we say the child has been served.
  We can serve a regular sandwich to a child only if the child is not allergic to gluten.
  We can serve a regular sandwich to a child only if the child is waiting for the sandwich at the table.
  We can serve a regular sandwich to a child only if the sandwich is on a tray and the tray is at the table where the child is waiting.
  Once we serve a regular sandwich to a child, the sandwich is no longer on the tray.
  Once we serve a regular sandwich to a child, we say the child has been served.
  We can move a tray from from-place to to-place only if the tray is at from-place.
  Once we move a tray from from-place to to-place, the tray is no longer at from-place but is at to-place.

  We can make a gluten-free {0} only if there is a {2} at kitchen and the {2} is gluten-free.
  Once we make a gluten-free {0}, the {1} and {2} are no longer at kitchen.
  Once we make a gluten-free {0}, the {0} is at kitchen and is gluten-free.

  ['make_sandwich']
  We can make a regular {0} only if there is a {1} at kitchen.
  We can make a regular {0} only if there is a {2} at kitchen.
  Once we make a regular {0}, the {1} and {2} are no longer at kitchen.
  Once we make a regular {0}, the {0} is at kitchen.

  ['put_on_tray']
  We can put a {0} on a {1} only if the {0} is at kitchen.
  We can put a {0} on a {1} only if the {1} is also at kitchen.
  Once we put a {0} on a {1}, the {0} is no longer at kitchen but is on the {1}.

  ['serve_sandwich_no_gluten']
  We can serve a gluten-free {0} to an allergic {1} only if the {1} is allergic to gluten.
  We can serve a gluten-free {0} to an allergic {1} only if the {0} is on a {2} and the {0} is gluten-free.
  We can serve a gluten-free {0} to an allergic {1} only if the {1} is waiting for the {0} at the {3}.
  We can serve a regular {0} to a {1} only if the {2} is at the {3} where the {1} is waiting.

  Once we serve a gluten-free {0} to an allergic {1}, the {0} is no longer on the {2}.
  Once we serve a gluten-free {0} to an allergic {1}, we say the {1} has been served.

  ['serve_sandwich']
  We can serve a regular {0} to a {1} only if the {1} is not allergic to gluten.
  We can serve a regular {0} to a {1} only if the child is waiting for the {0} at the {3}.
  We can serve a regular {0} to a {1} only if the {0} is on a {2} and the {2} is at the {3} where the {1} is waiting.
  Once we serve a regular {0} to a {1}, the {0} is no longer on the {2}.
  Once we serve a regular {0} to a {1}, we say the {1} has been served.

  ['move_tray']
  We can move a {0} from {1} to {2} only if the {0} is at {1}.
  Once we move a {0} from {1} to {2}, the {0} is no longer at {1} but is at {2}.
