   I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. 

   Here are the actions that can be performed:

   Pick up a block
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Put down a block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   The following are the restrictions on the actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking is clear.
   Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
   Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

   The following are the restrictions on the actions:

   ['pick-up']
   I can only pick up or unstack one block {0} at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack {0} if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a {0} if the {0} is on the table and the {0} is clear. A {0} is clear if the {0} has no other blocks on top of it and if the {0} is not picked up.
   Once I pick up a {0}, I am holding the {0}.

   ['put-down']
   I can only pick up or unstack one block {0} at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack {0} if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a {0} if the {0} is on the table and the {0} is clear. A {0} is clear if the {0} has no other blocks on top of it and if the {0} is not picked up.
   I can only put down a {0} that I am holding.
   Once I put down a {0}, my hand becomes empty.

   ['unstack']
   I can only unstack a {0} from on top of another {1} if the {0} I am unstacking was really on top of the other {1}.
   I can only unstack a {0} from on top of another {1} if the {0} I am unstacking is clear.
   Once unstack a {0}, I am holding the {0}.

   ['stack']
   I can only stack a {0} on top of another {1} if I am holding the {0} being stacked.
   I can only stack a {0} on top of another {1} if the {1} onto which I am stacking is clear.
   Once I stack a {0}, my hand becomes empty.
   Once you stack a {0} on top of a second {1}, the second {0} is no longer clear.
