  I have to plan the actions for a robotic bartender to prepare cocktails. The bartender has two hands and works with various containers and ingredients to mix and serve drinks.

  Here are the actions that can be performed:
  Grasp a container (shot or shaker) from the table.
  Leave a container on the table.
  Fill-shot with an ingredient from a dispenser. 
  Refill-shot with the same ingredient it contained before. 
  Empty a shot.
  Clean a shot.
  Pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker.
  Pour the content of a shot into a used shaker that already contain some ingredient.
  Empty a shaker.
  Clean a shaker.
  Shake the shaker to mix the ingredients.
  Pour the content of a shaker into a shot.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:
  We can grasp a container only if the container is on the table.
  We can grasp a container only our hand is empty.
  Once we grasp a container, we are holding the container and our hand is no longer empty.
  We can leave a container on the table only if we are holding the container.
  Once we leave a container on the table, the container is on the table and we are no longer holding the container.
  Once we leave a container on the table, our hand becomes empty.
  We can fill a shot with an ingredient only if one hand is holding the shot and the other hand is empty to manipulate the dispenser that contains the ingredient.
  We can fill a shot with an ingredient only if the shot is empty and clean.
  Once we fill a shot with an ingredient, the shot is no longer empty and clean.
  Once we fill a shot with an ingredient, the shot contains the ingredient and we say that the shot is used to store the ingredient.
  We can refill a shot with an ingredient only if the shot is used to store the same ingredient.
  We can refill a shot with an ingredient only if the shot is currently empty.
  We can refill a shot with an ingredient only if one hand is holding the shot and the other hand is empty to manipulate the dispenser that contains the ingredient.
  Once we refill a shot with an ingredient, the shot contains the ingredient and is no longer empty.
  We can empty a shot only if the shot contains some ingredient.
  We can empty a shot only if we are holding the shot.
  Once we empty a shot, the shot no more contains any ingredient and is empty.
  We can clean a shot only if we are holding the shot and another hand is empty to manipulate the cleaning equipment.
  We can clean a shot only if the shot is empty but is used to store some ingredient.
  Once we clean a shot, the shot is clean and is considered not used to store any ingredient.
  We can pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker only if we are holding the shot and the shot contains some ingredient.
  We can pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker only if the shaker is clean and empty.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker, the shaker contains the ingredient and thus the shaker is no longer empty.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker, the shot does not contain any ingredient and is empty.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a clean shaker, the shaker's fill level will increment one level.
  We can pour the content of a shot into a used shaker only if we are holding the shot and the shot contains some ingredient.
  We can pour the content of a shot into a used shaker only if the shaker has not been shaken yet.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a used shaker, the shaker contains the ingredients.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a used shaker, the shot does not contain any ingredient and is empty.
  Once we pour the content of a shot into a used shaker, the shaker's fill level will increment one level.
  We can empty a shaker only if we are holding the shaker.
  We can empty a shaker only if the shaker contains some cocktails.
  We can empty a shaker only if the shaker has been shaken.
  Once we empty a shaker, the shaker no longer contains any cocktails and is empty.
  Once we empty a shaker, the shaker's fill level will become zero.
  Once we empty a shaker, the shaker is considered not shaken.
  We can clean a shaker only if we are holding the shaker and another hand is empty to manipulate the cleaning equipment.
  We can clean a shaker only if the shaker is empty.
  Once we clean a shaker, the shaker is clean.
  We can shake a shaker only if we are holding the shaker and the shaker contains two types of ingredients.
  We can shake a shaker only if the shaker has not yet shaken.
  Once we shake a shaker, the shaker contains a cocktail that is a mixture of the two ingredients.
  Once we shake a shaker, the shaker is considered shaken.
  We can pour the content of a shaker into a shot only if we are holding the shaker and the shaker contains a cocktail.
  We can pour the content of a shaker into a shot only if the shot is empty and clean.
  Once we pour the content of a shaker into a shot, the shot contains the cocktail and the shot is not empty.
  Once we pour the content of a shaker into a shot, the shot is not clean.
  Once we pour the content of a shaker into a shot, the shaker's fill level will decrement one level.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:

  ['grasp']
  We can grasp {1} only if the {1} is on the table.
  We can grasp a {1} only {0} is empty.

  Once we grasp a {1}, we are holding the {1} and {0} is no longer empty.

  ['leave']
  We can leave a {0} on the table only if we are holding the {0}.

  Once we leave a {0} on the table, the {0} is on the table and we are no longer holding the {0}.
  Once we leave a {0} on the table, our {1} becomes empty.

  ['fill-shot']
  We can fill a {0} with an {1} only if one {2} is holding the {0} and the other {3} is empty to manipulate the {4} that contains the {1}.
  We can fill a {0} with an {1} only if the {0} is empty and clean.

  Once we fill a {0} with an {1}, the {0} is no longer empty and clean.
  Once we fill a {0} with an {1}, the {0} contains the {1} and we say that the {0} is used to store the {1}.

  ['refill-shot']
  We can refill a {0} with an {1} only if the {0} is used to store the same {1}.
  We can refill a {0} with an {1} only if the {0} is currently empty.
  We can refill a {0} with an {1} only if one {2} is holding the {0} and the other {3} is empty to manipulate the {4} that contains the {1}.
