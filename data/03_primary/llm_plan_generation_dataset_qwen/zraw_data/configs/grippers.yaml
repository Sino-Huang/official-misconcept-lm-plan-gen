  I have to plan how to move objects between rooms using a robot with grippers. The robot can move between rooms and pick up or drop objects using its grippers.

  Here are the actions that can be performed:

  Move the robot from one room to another room.
  A robot pick up an object from a room.
  A robot drop an object in a room.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:
  A robot can move from one room to another room only if the robot is in the from-room.
  Once the robot has moved from one room to another room, the robot is no longer in the from-room and is in the to-room.
  A robot can pick up an object from a room only if the robot is in the room and the object is also in the same room.
  A robot can pick up an object from a room only if the robot's gripper is free.
  Once the robot has picked up an object from a room, the object is no longer in the room and is carried by the robot.
  Once the robot has picked up an object from a room, the robot's gripper is no longer free.
  A robot can drop an object in a room only if the robot is in the room and the robot is carrying the object.
  Once the robot has dropped an object in a room, the object is in the room and is no longer carried by the robot.
  Once the robot has dropped an object in a room, the robot's gripper is free.

  A robot pick up an object from a room.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:

  ['move']
  A {0} can move from {1} to {2} only if the {0} is in the {1}.
  Once the {0} has moved from {1} to {2}, the {0} is no longer in the {1} and is in the {2}.

  ['pick']
  A {0} can pick up an {1} from a {2} only if the {0} is in the {2} and the {1} is also in the same {2}.
  A {0} can pick up an {1} from a {2} only if the {0}'s {3} is free.
  Once the {0} has picked up an {1} from a {2}, the {1} is no longer in the {2} and is carried by the {0}.
  Once the {0} has picked up an {1} from a {2}, the {0}'s {3} is no longer free.

  ['drop']
  A {0} can drop an {1} in a {2} only if the {0} is in the {2} and the {0} is carrying the {1}.
  Once the {0} has dropped an {1} in a {2}, the {1} is in the {2} and is no longer carried by the {0}.
  Once the {0} has dropped an {1} in a {2}, the {0}'s {3} is free.
