  I have to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which involves stacking a number of discs of different sizes. The puzzle starts with the discs neatly stacked in ascending order of size, the smallest at the top, making a conical shape.

  Here are the actions I can do

    Move a disc from its parent disc to the top of a target disc.

  The following are the restrictions on the actions:
    Only one disc can be moved at a time.
    A disc can only be moved if the target disc is larger than the disc being moved.
    A disc can be moved from one parent disc to another target disc only if the disc is directly on top of the parent disc.
    A disc can be moved only if there is no disc on top of it (in other words, this disc can be moved only if this disc is clear).
    A disc can be move to the top of another disc only if the target disc has no disc on top of it.
    Once a disc has been moved, the original parent disc has no disc on top of it.
    Once a disc has been moved, the disc is on top of the target disc.
    Once a disc has been moved, the disc is no longer on top of the parent disc.
    Once a disc has been moved, the target disc is no longer clear as it has a disc on top of it.

actions:
  {
    move: "move {} from {} to {}"
  }

predicates:
  {
    "clear": "{} is clear",
    "on": "{} is on top of {}",
    "smaller": "{} is larger than {}"
  }
