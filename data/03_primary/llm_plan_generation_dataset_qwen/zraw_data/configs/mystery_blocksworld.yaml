   I am playing with a set of objects. 
   Here are the actions that can be performed:

      Attack object
      Feast object from another object
      Succumb object
      Overcome object from another object
   
   The following are the restrictions on the actions:
      I can only attack or feast one object at a time.
      I can only attack or feast an object if there is harmony.
      I can only attack an object if the object is a planet and the object is a province. An object is a province if the object does not crave any other object and if the object is not being attacked.
      I can only feast an object from on top of another object if the object I am feasting craves the other object.
      I can only feast an object from on top of another object if the object I am feasting is a province.
      Once I attack or feast an object, there is pain with the object.
      I can only succumb an object if there is pain with the object.
      I can only overcome an object from another object if there is pain with the object being overcome.
      I can only overcome an object from another object if the object onto which I am overcoming the object is a province.
      Once I succumb or overcome an object, there is harmony.
      Once you overcome an object from a second object, the second object is no longer a province.
